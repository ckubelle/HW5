## Process
### 1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?
Starting with kanban, the most helpful aspect of using the workflow management method was that it allowed us as a group to keep track of all the features we had to implement while only being able to code just one or two features at a time. When developing a large application, it can be overwhelming to keep track of all the features you intend to implement and it is much easier to have one source where all these features are stored. While coding one feature, you may think of another that needs to be implemented. Or, you may find a bug that needs to be fixed. Having one location to describe all these issues to you and your teammates helped prevent important features of our project from being forgotten about. Not to mention that different developers may have different perspectives about how certain features are supposed to work, and kanban does a great job of keeping everyone on the same page since everyone can view the project board at any time. By creating issues and incorporating them on our kanban board, we were able to easily delegate work in a fair manner. During our sprint meetings, we would discuss who would like to work on a specific issue and then assign that person to that issue within kanban. It was also helpful that we could assign labels to certain issues. This allowed our group to label each task based on importance (1,3,5,8) and any other labels that were significant.

Using pull requests and reviewing each other’s code increased the overall efficiency of our bot. By using these methods we prevented unintended features from getting pushed onto our main branch. If we were working on an application used by millions of users, having an unintended feature getting pushed to the main version could be disastrous. However, by doing pull requests we were able to better understand each other’s work and fix certain parts of each other’s code that could cause bugs or errors. For example, there was one instance where a group member’s code had an unnecessary for loop which was not needed. There was another instance where the names of variables were confusing and could have been clearer. Without doing pull requests and code reviews, we may have let these non optimal aspects of our code get pushed to our main version of our bot. This is obviously not optimal.
### 2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
### 3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
 
## Overall
### 1. Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
