## Process
### 1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?
Starting with kanban, the most helpful aspect of using the workflow management method was that it allowed us as a group to keep track of all the features we had to implement while only being able to code just one or two features at a time. When developing a large application, it can be overwhelming to keep track of all the features you intend to implement and it is much easier to have one source where all these features are stored. While coding one feature, you may think of another that needs to be implemented. Or, you may find a bug that needs to be fixed. Having one location to describe all these issues to you and your teammates helped prevent important features of our project from being forgotten about. Not to mention that different developers may have different perspectives about how certain features are supposed to work, and kanban does a great job of keeping everyone on the same page since everyone can view the project board at any time. By creating issues and incorporating them on our kanban board, we were able to easily delegate work in a fair manner. During our sprint meetings, we would discuss who would like to work on a specific issue and then assign that person to that issue within kanban. It was also helpful that we could assign labels to certain issues. This allowed our group to label each task based on importance (1,3,5,8) and any other labels that were significant.

Using pull requests and reviewing each other’s code increased the overall efficiency of our bot. By using these methods we prevented unintended features from getting pushed onto our main branch. If we were working on an application used by millions of users, having an unintended feature getting pushed to the main version could be disastrous. However, by doing pull requests we were able to better understand each other’s work and fix certain parts of each other’s code that could cause bugs or errors. For example, there was one instance where a group member’s code had an unnecessary for loop which was not needed. There was another instance where the names of variables were confusing and could have been clearer. Without doing pull requests and code reviews, we may have let these non optimal aspects of our code get pushed to our main version of our bot. This is obviously not optimal.
### 2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
The most difficult part with the kanban board was accurately describing how each feature was to be implemented. With technical work it can be hard to describe how to implement a certain feature in words and I found that it took a long time to list each part of a feature. Personally, I had trouble describing what I envisioned in my mind onto a card or issue within kanban. I think at times my groupmates understood what I was describing over video chat and it was almost easier to just fix the issue than creating an issue on the kanban board. Creating descriptive issues on the kanban board is timely and that is my biggest complaint. Another aspect of kanban that I found was hard is the clutter that can arise within kanban. As the number of cards increase, you have to constantly scroll up or down within the columns. Additionally, I wish there was a better way to organize the cards other than by creating more columns. What I mean by this is I wish there was an inheritance like feature that allowed you to create sub cards or super cards. This feature would be useful because some cards were related to one another and it would be nice to categorize them this way. If I were to do things differently, I would create more columns related to the type of work required. For example, I would have a ‘UI’ column or a ‘Database’ column. This would help prevent one column containing a lot of tasks. Knowing what I know now, I would only include issues within the project board and not cards. The benefit to this is that you can assign people issues and not cards. You can also add longer comments, and labels. Our group started doing this mid way through the process milestone and once we made this change I think the project board was much more readable. 

I did not have that much difficulty with code review. The most difficult part was when we all git merged and had to ensure that our code worked with each other’s code. I always get worried that the work I did will get deleted whenever I git merge but luckily this did not happen. I had to do some research on how to resolve a merge conflict and by following a github tutorial I was able to resolve the conflicts and merge properly. If I were to do things differently I would simply start creating different branches more early on in development. We chose to solely work on the main branch initially because we wanted to just start coding away.. But in hindsight, it may have been more wise to take the time to create different branches.

### 3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
 
## Overall
### 1. Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
